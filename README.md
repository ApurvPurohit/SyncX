# *SyncX - File Transfer Utility*

A File Transfer Application for the seamless tranfer of single/multiple files between PC and Android Devices without any physical connection. This utility is under improvement and your feedback/contribution on any aspect will be appreciated. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Tkinter, the standard GUI library for Python

```
pip install tkinter
```

### How to Use

#### For Windows:
1. Download the repository code, and unzip it's contents.
2. Run SyncX.exe. This opens the configuration-master for the first time. Here, you have to fill your PC's IP Address, Buffer Size and Saved Folder location.
   (NOTE: Buffer Size should be set greater than 102400 during configuration). This opens the main interface for sending/recieving files.
3. Download and install the APK file on your Android device.
4. Connect the app to the PC Application using the IP Address of your PC in the app.
5. Now you are all set up. The files can be sent from your Android device to PC and vice-versa.

#### To find the IP Address of your PC, run the following command in terminal:
```
ipconfig
```
#### For Mac/Linux
1. Download the repository code, and unzip it's contents.
2. Run SyncX.py in the terminal. This opens the configuration-master for the first time. Here, you have to fill your PC's IP Address, Buffer Size and Saved Folder location.
   (NOTE: Buffer Size should be set greater than 102400 during configuration). This opens the main interface for sending/recieving files.
3. Download and install the APK file on your Android device.
4. Connect the app to the PC Application using the IP Address of your PC in the app.
5. Now you are all set up. The files can be sent from your Android device to PC and vice-versa.
